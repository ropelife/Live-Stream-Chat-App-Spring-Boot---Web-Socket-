# Live Stream Chat App (Spring-Boot - Web-Socket)

Implemented a real-time communication in a Spring Boot application using WebSocket. WebSocket allows bidirectional, full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling efficient real-time data exchange between clients and servers. With Spring Boot and WebSocket, weâ€™ll set it up so our app can handle these real-time chats smoothly.
